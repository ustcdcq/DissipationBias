# Steering Active-Colloid Assembly by Biasing Dissipation



This repository implements a **clone algorithm** to bias the **dissipation tendency** of a colloidal self-assembly system, enabling **directed self-assembly**.



Core idea: by tuning the bias factor **α (alpha)**, trajectories are reweighted according to their dissipation, and a **cloning/pruning** mechanism adjusts the copy number of trajectories. This amplifies either **energy-avoiding** (low-dissipation) or **energy-seeking** (high-dissipation) pathways, thereby steering the assembly outcome (e.g., disorder/stripe/trimer).

## 🚀 Usage



Clone the repository and compile the code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ustcdcq/Dissipation.git

cd src

make -j8

./CC
```

## 📺 Demo

You can load the following files from the **`Output`** directory into `OVITO` to visualize the simulation trajectory.

file format:`A_40.0_Ks_220.0_clone_id.dump`

You can find the clone-information file `info_cloneid.txt` from `/Gen/Output` directory. The file is formatted as follows: 

- column 1: `dissipation`
- column 2:`clone number`
- column 3: `father id` 
- column 4: `disorder ratio`
- column 5: `stripe ratio`
- column 6: `trimer ratio`

## 🧾 Information

*A rich variety of structures with distinct functions can be generated through  
complex nonequilibrium self-assembly, yet directing the system toward a desired  
target state remains challenging because multiple dynamical pathways may  
coexist and fluctuations can determine the outcome. In this work, we propose a  
thermodynamic control principle for nonequilibrium targeted assembly in which  
tuning the dissipation tendency modulates the frequency and intensity of local  
rearrangements, thereby reshaping assembly pathways and enabling directional  
self-assembly when competing structures dissipate differently.*

*Using the assembly of active core–corona colloids  
as a platform, we demonstrate two representative capabilities enabled by this  
principle: (i) Inducing ordered target configurations from disordered  
structures; (ii) Directionally selecting among competing assembly pathways.Using the assembly of active core–corona colloids
